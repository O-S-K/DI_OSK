 Dependency Injection in Unity Snake Game
Overview
This document provides an overview of how Dependency Injection (DI) is implemented in the Unity Snake Game project. Dependency Injection is used to manage dependencies between different game components, allowing for better modularity, testability, and flexibility in the codebase.

What is Dependency Injection?
Dependency Injection is a design pattern widely used in software development to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC). In the context of this Unity project, DI helps decouple components and services by injecting dependencies rather than having components create their dependencies directly.

Components of the Project
DIContainer Class
The DIContainer class serves as a simple Dependency Injection container in this project. It allows bindings between interfaces and their concrete implementations or instances.

Methods
Bind<TInterface, TImplementation>(): Binds an interface TInterface to a concrete implementation TImplementation.
ProvideInstance<TInterface>(instance): Binds an interface TInterface to a provided instance.
Inject(target): Injects dependencies into an object target by setting its fields annotated with [Inject].
Using DI in the Snake Game
1. Binding Dependencies
Dependencies are bound to their interfaces and provided to the DIContainer. This happens typically during initialization, such as in the Awake() method of GameInstaller.

Example:
DIContainer.Bind<IDataSO>(() => dataSO);
DIContainer.Bind<IGameController>(() => gameController);
DIContainer.Bind<ISnake>(() => snake);
DIContainer.Bind<IInput>(() => input);
2. Injecting Dependencies
Dependencies are injected into the relevant game components, such as the Snake class, using [Inject] annotations.

Example:
[Inject] private IDataSO dataSO;
[Inject] private IGameController gameController;
[Inject] private ISnake snake;
[Inject] private IInput input;
3. Using Injected Dependencies
Once injected, these dependencies can be used throughout the codebase, promoting loosely coupled interactions between game components.

Benefits of Dependency Injection
Modularity: Components are more modular and easier to replace or upgrade.
Testability: Dependencies can be mocked or replaced during testing.
Flexibility: Changing dependencies is easier and less error-prone.
Conclusion
Dependency Injection plays a crucial role in managing the complexity and dependencies of the Unity Snake Game project. By decoupling components and managing dependencies externally, the project becomes more maintainable and extensible.
